#Disign Principles and Philosophy

*"Successful Software Lives For Ever"*

This document introduces the design principles/philiosphy of the project lead Robert Osfield.  The principles draw upon the experience of being project lead of the [OpenSceneGraph](https://www.openscenegraph.org) and leassons learned from the real-time compute graphics, C++, and open source/free software communities.

First lets break down the opening phrase, *"Successful Software Lives For Ever"*, one I coined for a training course over a decade ago:

>What is *"Success Software"* : Software that is useful and reliable enough to developers and/or users to adopt it as a part of their work or personal lives and rely upon it to live for as long as they need it.

>How long is *"For Ever"* : Long enough that time during maintainance and evolution is significantly longer than initial time to develop the first stable release.  Software that is unreliable, hard to maintain and evolve becomes unsustainable in the long term, it looses it's relevance because of it and fails. Success dmands good design, implementation and responsive curation over many years. 


For the OpenSceneGraph project what made it a success was it achieved ***performance*** levels that competed well with the best propritary and open source scene graphs, and was well designed enough to help with developers be ***productive*** over long term application development and deployment. Responsive of contributors to support of community  has also been crucial for the OpenSceneGraph remaining relevent to real-time graphics application developers for nearly two decades.

Technology moves on, Vulkan is displacing OpenGL is the graphics API of choice for high performance cross platform graphics development.  C++ has begun evolving more rapidly and now C++17 offers many features that make appplications faster, more robust and easier to develop and maintain. Ideas on scene graphs have also advanced, a well designed clean room scene graph has the potential for improving graphics and compute performance and developer productivity beyond the previous start of art.  The VulkanSceneGraph project goal is to embody the potential of Vulkan and modern C++ and create middle-ware for next generation of graphics applications, and for it to remain a valued tool for the next decade and beyond.

There are two broad areas that will determine the ***Success*** of VulkanSceneGraph : ***Performance*** and ***Productivity***.  The rest of this document will break these down areas and discuss the design principles that will aim to deliver in these areas.

##Performance

Go faster stripes!

##Productivity

Pretty labels.
