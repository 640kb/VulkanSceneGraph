## Suggestions in osg-users ML/forum post from Paweł Księżopolski

Vulkan specification is the most comprehensive source of knowledge about
the API - it's long but it is a must for any developer taking it seriously :

* [Vulkan Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1/html/vkspec.html)

As for the books I recommend "Vulkan Programming Guide" written
by Graham Sellers. Sometime ago it was even available for free in
certain countries on Google Play bookstore :

* [Vulkan Programming Guide](http://www.vulkanprogrammingguide.com/)

Active forums discussing Vulkan include Khronos forums :

* [Khronos Vulkan Discussion Forum](https://forums.khronos.org/forumdisplay.php/114-Vulkan-High-Efficiency-GPU-Graphics-and-Compute)

and Vulkan subreddit :

 * [Vulkan Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vulkan/)

Sascha Willems wrote a good set of Vulkan demos, that show how to
implement certain features :

* [Vulkan Demos](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan)
* [Sascha Willems website](ttps://www.saschawillems.de/)

There's also a curated list of useful links to everything
associated with Vulkan :
